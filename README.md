# FNF Central Charts

This is where we currently store all the charts for FNF Central. Expect this to change in the near future.

This is hosted at [charts.fnfcentral.com](https://charts.fnfcentral.com).

All files are formatted with Prettier. Just use the VSCode extension if you don't like it.

## Getting Everything Working

Run `helm package <package_path>` to package the chart.

Then run `helm repo index docs --url https://charts.fnfcentral.com` to set up the index.
